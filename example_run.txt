=== Notes ===

Feedback Colors:
- G = Green (correct letter in correct position)
- Y = Yellow (correct letter in wrong position)
- . = Grey (letter not in word)

Position Distances (when enabled):
- Shows the distance a Yellow letter needs to move to reach its correct position
- Example: [pos0:+1] means the letter at position 0 needs to move 1 position to the right

Hints:
- Mode 1: Shows a correct letter in its correct position (e.g., _o__e)
- Mode 2: Shows correct letters without position information (e.g., a, l, n)
- Hints are cumulative and displayed before each guess

Solver:
- Provides intelligent guesses based on remaining candidate words
- Updates after each guess based on feedback
- Shows remaining candidate count when hints are enabled
